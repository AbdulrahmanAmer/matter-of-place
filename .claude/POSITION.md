# POSITION — Matter of Place

Newest block at the bottom. One block per closed unit of work. Record BLOCKED / UNPROVEN / PARTIAL explicitly.

## 2026-09-30 — Step zero: workspace set up, everything indexed

DONE
- Read: README, AGENTS.md, roadmap, docs/** (architecture, services, data model, caching, schema, deploy, 5 ADRs),
  brief/master-plan + brief/recalibration, .lovable/plan/*, key src files (site.ts, exposure.ts, analytics.ts,
  nav-links.ts, services/types.ts, server.ts, vite.config.ts, tokens.css, strings.ts).
- Verified the MVP: `bun install` ok; `bun run typecheck` exit 0; `bun run lint` clean; `bun run build` exit 0
  (nitro cloudflare_module, emits .output/server/wrangler.json).
- Installed at project scope (E:\Matter Of Place\.claude\settings.json): claude-security, security-guidance,
  code-review, pr-review-toolkit, feature-dev, claude-md-management, commit-commands, hookify, cloudflare, resend,
  playwright, typescript-lsp, session-report, context7, skill-creator. agent-os was already installed globally.
- agent-os: `PROJECT-STATE.md` at STAGE 0, enforcement deny. Verified the gate denies
  `Matter Of Place Codebase/src/**` and `package.json`, allows `workspace/**`.
- codebase-memory: `.mcp.json` registered (loads next session); CLI index done: 2322 nodes / 8418 edges,
  project name `E-Matter Of Place-Matter Of Place Codebase`.
- workspace/01-site-index: pages-and-wording.md (20 URLs + chrome + forms + strings + 21 events),
  content-inventory.md (16 properties, 3 markets/12 regions, 6 stories, 4 products, FAQ, types, 31 images, 1 video),
  appendix-data-copy.md.
- workspace/00-MAP-OF-WHAT-WE-HAVE.md, 02-tech-stack/tech-stack.md (DRAFT, decisions D1–D13),
  03-diagrams/big-diagram.md (DRAFT), 04-completion-map/completion-map.md (DRAFT).
- Worker agents: .claude/agents/mop-designer, mop-builder, mop-scout, mop-auditor (Sonnet med / Haiku low).

FOUND (not fixed — stage 0 forbids src edits)
- Home `<title>` duplicates the suffix: "Matter of Place | Exceptional property. Properly considered. | Matter of Place"
  (`pageHead` in src/lib/seo.ts only skips the suffix when the title already ends with it).
- contact.email/phone, legal.entity/address, VITE_INSTAGRAM_URL all unset → contact lines, legal lines, Instagram link
  do not render. Owner input.
- README says Vite 7; package.json pins vite 8.1.5.

BLOCKED / WAITING ON OPERATOR
- No `.git` in the codebase folder and no GitHub remote known → CI, deploys from git, code review plugins on PRs.
- Decisions D1–D13 in PROJECT-STATE.md (deploy target, API placement, email, payments, social platforms, audit cadence, domain).

NEXT
- Operator reads workspace/02-tech-stack/tech-stack.md and answers the decisions; then STAGE → 2 (system design) and
  we write the sliced plan from the completion map.
